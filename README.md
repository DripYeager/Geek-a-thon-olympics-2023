## Project Description:
Team Utopia participated in the Geek-A-Thon hackathon organized by GeeksforGeeks. Our project aims to enhance the Olympic experience for athletes, coaches, officials, and spectators by leveraging data science, machine learning, and data analysis. We have created a comprehensive web application that provides valuable insights, real-time updates, interactive experiences, and more for all Olympic enthusiasts.

## Project Features:

- ### Landing Page:
The website greets users with a visually appealing landing page that provides basic information about the upcoming Olympic event, including the location, number of events, participating countries, athletes, and the starting date of the Olympic Games 2024.
- ### Analysis Dashboard:
The heart of our application is the analysis dashboard, where we utilize data science techniques to derive valuable insights from historical Olympic data. The dashboard is powered by Streamlit and offers the following sections:

- Medley Tele: Users can explore the medals won by a specific country in a particular year.
- Overall Analysis: A comprehensive analysis of all Olympics, including host information, sports, winning nations, and winning athletes. Various graphs illustrate trends and patterns over the years.
- Country-wise Analysis: Allows users to check the performance analysis of a specific country in all Olympics, along with the top-performing athletes.
- ### Ticket Booking System:
For users who wish to experience the thrill of the Olympics in person, we have integrated a seamless ticket booking system. Users can log in and choose their preferred seats for the events they want to witness.
- ### Forum Section:
The forum section serves as an interactive discussion platform for fans, coaches, officials, and enthusiasts to engage in conversations, share thoughts, and exchange ideas related to the Olympics.
